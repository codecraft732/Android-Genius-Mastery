/*
currentImage = (currentImage + 1) % 4
explain this formula
Initial Value: currentImage starts at 0.

First Click:

currentImage = (0 + 1) % 4
currentImage = 1 % 4
Quotient: 0 (since 1 รท 4 = 0.25, integer part is 0)(0.25*4=1)
Remainder: 1
Result: currentImage = 1
Second Click:

currentImage = (1 + 1) % 4
currentImage = 2 % 4
Quotient: 0 (since 2 รท 4 = 0.5, integer part is 0)(0.5*4=2)
Remainder: 2
Result: currentImage = 2
Third Click:

currentImage = (2 + 1) % 4
currentImage = 3 % 4
Quotient: 0 (since 3 รท 4 = 0.75, integer part is 0)(0.75*4=3)
Remainder: 3
Result: currentImage = 3
Fourth Click:

currentImage = (3 + 1) % 4
currentImage = 4 % 4
Quotient: 1 (since 4 รท 4 = 1, integer part is 1)(1*4=4) there is no 4 image means 0
Remainder: 0
Result: currentImage = 0
And so on...

/*explain some xml points.
when  u are using constraint layout then must doing constraint
for all four sides otherwise when u are running it places your components somewhere else.

how to constraint it for all four sides middle dot put your arrow on that and strech it from its back

how to add image button in xml add image button where
we add images scroll down search previous or next button

new attribute alpha 0 0means pic invisible or 1 means pic visible darker*/
